Culinaire adds a ton of new food items to the game, such as vegetables with crops (tomatoes, lettuce) and composed meals (pies, salads, sandwiches).  
New pastry-related food also have been added, such as the French chouquettes, marshmallows and more to come.

Players are also able to craft kettles and brew tea using a source of heat, water, a bottle and a tea bag.  
Each flavor of tea comes with a different effect, that can vary with the amount of ingredients you put in the tea bag.

You can also make cheese by pouring milk into a cauldron and waiting for it to finally coagulate.
